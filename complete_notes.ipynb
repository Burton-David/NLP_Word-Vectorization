congress honored guests my fellow americans:',\n 'we are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history never before has our nation enjoyed at once so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis and so few external threats never before have we had such a blessed opportunity and therefore such a profound obligation to build the more perfect union of our founders dreams',\n 'we begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs; the fastest economic growth in more than 30 years; the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years; the lowest poverty rates in 20 years; the lowest african american and hispanic unemployment rates on record; the first backto back surpluses in 42 years; and next month america will achieve the longest period of economic growth in our entire history we have built a new economy',\n 'and our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the american spirit: crime down by 20 percent to its lowest level in 25 years; teen births down 7 years in a row; adoptions up by 30 percent; welfare rolls cut in half to their lowest levels in 30 years',\n 'my fellow americans the state of our union is the strongest it has ever been',\n 'as always the real credit belongs to the american people my gratitude also goes to those of you in this chamber who have worked with us to put progress over partisanship',\n 'eight years ago it was not so clear to most americans there would be much to celebrate in the year 2000 then our nation was gripped by economic distress social decline political gridlock the title of a bestselling book asked: \"america: what went wrong\"',\n 'in the best traditions of our nation americans determined to set things right we restored the vital center replacing outmoded ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic enduring values: opportunity for all responsibility from all a community of all americans we reinvented government transforming it into a catalyst for new ideas that stress both opportunity and responsibility and give our people the tools they need to solve their own problems',\n 'with the smallest federal work force in 40 years we turned record deficits into record surpluses and doubled our investment in education we cut crime with 100000 community police and the brady law which has kept guns out of the hands of half a million criminals',\n 'we ended welfare as we knew it requiring work while protecting health care and nutrition for children and investing more in child care transportation and housing to help their parents go to work weve helped parents to succeed at home and at work with family leave which 20 million americans have now used to care for a newborn child or a sick loved one weve engaged 150000 young americans in citizen service through americorps while helping them earn money for college',\n 'in 1992 we just had a roadmap today we have results',\n 'even more important america again has the confidence to dream big dreams but we must not let this confidence drift into complacency for we all of us will be judged by the dreams and deeds we pass on to our children and on that score we will be held to a high standard indeed because our chance to do good is so great',\n 'my fellow americans we have crossed the bridge we built to the 21st century now we must shape a 21st century american revolution of opportunity responsibility and community we must be now as we were in the beginning a new nation',\n 'at the dawn of the last century theodore roosevelt said \"the one characteristic more essential than any other is foresight    it should be the growing nation with a future that takes the long look ahead\" so tonight let us take our long look ahead and set great goals for our nation',\n 'to 21st century america let us pledge these things: every child will begin school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed every family will be able to succeed at home and at work and no child will be raised in poverty we will meet the challenge of the aging of america we will assure quality affordable health care at last for all americans',\n 'we will make america the safest big country on earth we will pay off our national debt for the first time since 1835* we will bring prosperity to every american community we will reverse the course of climate change and leave a safer cleaner planet america will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity and the far frontiers of science and technology and we will become at last what our founders pledged us to be so long ago: one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all',\n 'these are great goals worthy of a great nation we will not reach them all this year not even in this decade but we will reach them let us remember that the first american revolution was not won with a single shot; the continent was not settled in a single year the lesson of our history and the lesson of the last 7 years is that great goals are reached step by step always building on our progress always gaining ground',\n 'of course you cant gain ground if youre standing still and for too long this congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities so lets begin tonight with them',\n 'again i ask you to pass a real patients bill of rights i ask you to pass commonsense gun safety legislation i ask you to pass campaign finance reform i ask you to vote up or down on judicial nominations and other important appointees and again i ask youi implore you to raise the minimum wage',\n 'in 1993 we began to put our fiscal house in order with the deficit reduction act which youll all remember won passages in both houses by just a single vote your former colleague my first secretary of the treasury led that effort and sparked our long boom hes here with us tonight lloyd bentsen you have served america well and we thank you',\n 'beyond paying off the debt we must ensure that the benefits of debt reduction go to preserving two of the most important guarantees we make to every american social security and medicare tonight i ask you to work with me to make a bipartisan downpayment on social security reform by crediting the interest savings from debt reduction to the social security trust fund so that it will be strong and sound for the next 50 years',\n 'but this is just the start of our journey we must also take the right steps toward reaching our great goals first and foremost we need a 21st century revolution in education guided by our faith that every single child can learn because education is more important than ever more than ever the key to our childrens future we must make sure all our children have that key that means quality preschool and after school the best trained teachers in the classroom and college opportunities for all our children',\n 'for 7 years now weve worked hard to improve our schools with opportunity and responsibility investing more but demanding more in turn reading math college entrance scores are up some of the most impressive gains are in schools in very poor neighborhoods',\n 'but all successful schools have followed the same proven formula: higher standards more accountability and extra help so children who need it can get it to reach those standards i have sent congress a reform plan based on that formula it holds states and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results each year our national government invests more than $15 billion in our schools it is time to support what works and stop supporting what doesnt',\n 'now as we demand more from our schools we should also invest more in our schools lets double our investment to help states and districts turn around their worstperforming schools or shut them down lets double our investments in afterschool and summer school programs which boost achievement and keep people off the streets and out of trouble if we do this we can give every single child in every failing school in americaeveryonethe chance to meet high standards',\n 'since 1993 weve nearly doubled our investment in head start and improved its quality tonight i ask you for another $1 billion for head start the largest increase in the history of the program',\n 'we know that children learn best in smaller classes with good teachers for 2 years in a row congress has supported my plan to hire 100000 new qualified teachers to lower class size in the early grades i thank you for that and i ask you to make it three in a row and to make sure all teachers know the subjects they teach tonight i propose a new teacher quality initiative to recruit more talented people into the classroom reward good teachers for staying there and give all teachers the training they need',\n 'we know charter schools provide real public school choice when i became president there was just one independent public charter school in all america today thanks to you there are 1700 i ask you now to help us meet our goal of 3000 charter schools by next year',\n 'we know we must connect all our classrooms to the internet and were getting there in 1994 only 3 percent of our classrooms were connected today with the help of the vice presidents erate program more than half of them are and 90 percent of our schools have at least one internet connection but we cannot finish the job when a third of all our schools are in serious disrepair many of them have walls and wires so old theyre too old for the internet so tonight i propose to help 5000 schools a year make immediate and urgent repairs and again to help build or modernize 6000 more to get students out of trailers and into hightech classrooms',\n 'i ask all of you to help me double our bipartisan gear up program which provides mentors for disadvantaged young people if we double it we can provide mentors for 14 million of them lets also offer these kids from disadvantaged backgrounds the same chance to take the same college testprep courses wealthier students use to boost their test scores',\n 'to make the american dream achievable for all we must make college affordable for all for 7 years on a bipartisan basis we have taken action toward that goal: larger pell grants more affordable student loans education iras and our hope scholarships which have already benefited 5 million young people',\n 'now 67 percent of high school graduates are going on to college thats up 10 percent since 1993 yet millions of families still strain to pay college tuition they need help so i propose a landmark $30 billion college opportunity tax cut a middle class tax deduction for up to $10000 in college tuition costs the previous actions of this congress have already made 2 years of college affordable for all its time make 4 years of college affordable for all if we take all these steps well move a long way toward making sure every child starts school ready to learn and graduates ready to succeed',\n 'we also need a 21st century revolution to reward work and strengthen families by giving every parent the tools to succeed at work and at the most important work of all raising children that means making sure every family has health care and the support to care for aging parents the tools to bring their children up right and that no child grows up in poverty',\n 'from my first days as president weve worked to give families better access to better health care in 1997 we passed the childrens health insurance programchipso that workers who dont have coverage through their employers at least can get it for their children so far weve enrolled 2 million children; were well on our way to our goal of 5 million',\n 'but there are still more than 40 million of our fellow americans without health insurance more than there were in 1993 tonight i propose that we follow vice president gores suggestion to make low income parents eligible for the insurance that covers their children together with our childrens initiativethink of thistogether with our childrens initiative this action would enable us to cover nearly a quarter of all the uninsured people in america',\n 'again i want to ask you to let people between the ages of 55 and 65 the fastest growing group of uninsured buy into medicare and this year i propose to give them a tax credit to make that choice an affordable one i hope you will support that as well',\n 'when the baby boomers retire medicare will be faced with caring for twice as many of our citizens; yet it is far from ready to do so my generation must not ask our childrens generation to shoulder our burden we simply must act now to strengthen and modernize medicare',\n 'my budget includes a comprehensive plan to reform medicare to make it more efficient and more competitive and it dedicates nearly $400 billion of our budget surplus to keep medicare solvent past 2025 and at long last it also provides funds to give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for prescription drugs',\n 'lifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern medicine no one creating a medicare program today would even think of excluding coverage for prescription drugs yet more than three in five of our seniors now lack dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their lives millions of older americans who need prescription drugs the most pay the highest prices for them in good conscience we cannot let another year pass without extending to all our seniors this lifeline of affordable prescription drugs',\n 'record numbers of americans are providing for aging or ailing loved ones at home its a loving but a difficult and often very expensive choice last year i proposed a $1000 tax credit for longterm care frankly it wasnt enough this year lets triple it to $3000 but this year lets pass it',\n 'we also have to make needed investments to expand access to mental health care i want to take a moment to thank the person who led our first white house conference on mental health last year and who for 7 years has led all our efforts to break down the barriers to decent treatment of people with mental illness thank you tipper gore',\n 'taken together these proposals would mark the largest investment in health care in the 35 years since medicare was createdthe largest investment in 35 years that would be a big step toward assuring quality health care for all americans young and old and i ask you to embrace them and pass them',\n 'we must also make investments that reward work and support families nothing does that better than the earnedincome tax credit the eitc the \"e\" in the eitc is about earning working taking responsibility and being rewarded for it in my very first address to you i asked congress to greatly expand this credit and you did as a result in 1998 alone the eitc helped more than 43 million americans work their way out of poverty toward the middle class thats double the number in 1993',\n 'tonight i propose another major expansion of the eitc: to reduce the marriage penalty to make sure it rewards marriage as it rewards work and also to expand the tax credit for families that have more than two children it punishes people with more than two children today our proposal would allow families with three or more children to get up to $1100 more in tax relief these are working families; their children should not be in poverty',\n 'we also cant reward work and family unless men and women get equal pay for equal work today the female unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in 46 years yet women still only earn about 75 cents for every dollar men earn we must do better by providing the resources to enforce present equal pay laws training more women for highpaying hightech jobs and passing the \"paycheck fairness act\"',\n 'many working parents spend up to a quartera quarterof their income on child care last year we helped parents provide child care for about 2 million children my child care initiative before you now along with funds already secured in welfare reform would make child care better safer and more affordable for another 400000 children i ask you to pass that they need it out there',\n 'for hardpressed middle income families we should also expand the child care tax credit and i believe strongly we should take the next big step and make that tax credit refundable for low income families for people making under $30000 a year that could mean up to $2400 for child care costs you know we all say were prowork and profamily passing this proposal would prove it',\n 'ten of millions of americans live from paycheck to paycheck as hard as they work they still dont have the opportunity to save too few can make use of iras and 401k plans we should do more to help all working families save and accumulate wealth thats the idea behind the individual development accounts the idas i ask you to take that idea to a new level with new retirement savings accounts that enable every low and moderateincome family in america to save for retirement a first home a medical emergency or a college education i propose to match their contributions however small dollar for dollar every year they save and i propose to give a major new tax credit to any small business that will provide a meaningful pension to its workers those people ought to have retirement as well as the rest of us',\n 'nearly one in three american children grows up without a father these children are 5 times more likely to live in poverty than children with both parents at home clearly demanding and supporting responsible fatherhood is critical to lifting all our children out of poverty weve doubled child support collections since 1992 and im proposing to you tough new measures to hold still more fathers responsible',\n 'if there is any single issue on which we should be able to reach across party lines it is in our common commitment to reward work and strengthen families just remember what we did last year we came together to help people with disabilities keep their health insurance when they go to work and i thank you for that thanks to overwhelming bipartisan support from this congress we have improved foster care weve helped those young people who leave it when they turn 18 and we have dramatically increased the number of foster care children going into adoptive homes i thank all of you for all of that',\n 'of course i am forever grateful to the person who has led our efforts from the beginning and whos worked so tirelessly for children and families for 30 years now my wife hillary and i thank her',\n 'if we take the steps just discussed we can go a long long way toward empowering parents to succeed at home and at work and ensuring that no child is raised in poverty we can make these vital investments in health care education support for working families and still offer tax cuts to help pay for college for retirement to care for aging parents to reduce the marriage penalty we can do these things without forsaking the path of fiscal discipline that got us to this point here tonight',\n 'indeed we must make these investments and these tax cuts in the context of a balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of social security and medicare and pays down the national debt',\n 'crime in america has dropped for the past 7 yearsthats the longest decline on recordthanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on community police sensible gun safety laws and effective prevention but nobody nobody here nobody in america believes were safe enough so again i ask you to set a higher goal lets make this country the safest big country in the world',\n 'last fall congress supported my plan to hire in addition to the 100000 community police weve already funded 50000 more concentrated in highcrime neighborhoods i ask your continued support for that',\n 'now we have all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands daniel mauser was only 15 years old when he was gunned down at columbine he was an amazing kid a straighta student a good skier like all parents who lose their children his father tom has borne unimaginable grief somehow he has found the strength to honor his son by transforming his grief into action earlier this month he took a leave of absence from his job to fight for tougher gun safety laws i pray that his courage and wisdom will at long last move this congress to make commonsense gun legislation the very next order of business tom mauser stand up we thank you for being here tonight tom thank you tom',\n 'we must strengthen our gun laws and enforce those already on the books better federal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since i took office but we must do more i propose to hire more federal and local gun prosecutors and more atf agents to crack down on illegal gun traffickers and badapple dealers and we must give them the enforcement tools that they need tools to trace every gun and every bullet used in every gun crime in the united states i ask you to help us do that',\n 'every state in this country already requires hunters and automobile drivers to have a license i think they ought to do the same thing for handgun purchases now specifically i propose a plan to ensure that all new handgun buyers must first have a photo license from their state showing they passed the brady background check and a gun safety course before they get the gun i hope youll help me pass that in this congress',\n 'listen to thislisten to this the accidental gun ratethe accidental gun death rate of children under 15 in the united states is 9 times higher than in the other 25 industrialized countries combined now technologies now exist that could lead to guns that can only be fired by the adults who own them i ask congress to fund research into smart gun technology to save these childrens lives i ask responsible leaders in the gun industry to work with us on smart guns and other steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands to keep our children safe',\n 'you know every parent i know worries about the impact of violence in the media on their children i want to begin by thanking the entertainment industry for accepting my challenge to put voluntary ratings on tv programs and video and internet games but frankly the ratings are too numerous diverse and confusing to be really useful to parents so tonight i ask the industry to accept the first ladys challenge to develop a single voluntary rating system for all childrens entertainment that is easier for parents to understand and enforce the steps i outline will take us well on our way to making america the safest big country in the world',\n 'now to keep our historic economic expansion going the subject of a lot of discussion in this community and others i believe we need a 21st century revolution to open new markets start new businesses hire new workers right here in america in our inner cities poor rural areas and native american reservations',\n 'our nations prosperity hasnt yet reached these places over the last 6 months ive traveled to a lot of them joined by many of you and many farsighted business people to shine a spotlight on the enormous potential in communities from appalachia to the mississippi delta from watts to the pine ridge reservation everywhere i go i meet talented people eager for opportunity and able to work tonight i ask you lets put them to work for business its the smart thing to do for america its the right thing to do and let me ask you something: if we dont do this now when in the wide world will we ever get around to it',\n 'so i ask congress to give businesses the same incentives to invest in americas new markets they now have to invest in markets overseas tonight i propose a large new markets tax credit and other incentives to spur $22 billion in privatesector capital to create new businesses and new investments in our inner cities and rural areas because empowerment zones have been creating these opportunities for 5 years now i also ask you to increase incentives to invest in them and to create more of them',\n 'and let me say to all of you again what i have tried to say at every turn: this is not a democratic or a republican issue giving people a chance to live their dreams is an american issue',\n 'mr speaker it was a powerful moment last november when you joined reverend jesse jackson and me in your home state of illinois and committed to working toward our common goal by combining the best ideas from both sides of the aisle i want to thank you again and to tell you mr speaker i look forward to working with you this is a worthy joint endeavor thank you',\n 'i also ask you to make special efforts to address the areas of our nation with the highest rates of poverty our native american reservations and the mississippi delta my budget includes a $110 million initiative to promote economic development in the delta and a billion dollars to increase economic opportunity health care education and law enforcement for our native american communities we should begin this new century by honoring our historic responsibility to empower the first americans and i want to thank tonight the leaders and the members from both parties whove expressed to me an interest in working with us on these efforts they are profoundly important',\n 'theres another part of our american community in trouble tonight our family farmers when i signed the farm bill in 1996 i said there was great danger it would work well in good times but not in bad well droughts floods and historically low prices have made these times very bad for the farmers we must work together to strengthen the farm safety net invest in land conservation and create some new markets for them by expanding our programs for biobased fuels and products please they need help lets do it together',\n 'opportunity for all requires something else today having access to a computer and knowing how to use it that means we must close the digital divide between those whove got the tools and those who dont connecting classrooms and libraries to the internet is crucial but its just a start my budget ensures that all new teachers are trained to teach 21st century skills and it creates technology centers in 1000 communities to serve adults this spring ill invite hightech leaders to join me on another new markets tour to close the digital divide and open opportunity for our people i want to thank the hightech companies that already are doing so much in this area i hope the new tax incentives i have proposed will get all the rest of them to join us this is a national crusade we have got to do this and do it quickly',\n 'now again i say to you these are steps but step by step we can go a long way toward our goal of bringing opportunity to every community',\n 'to realize the full possibilities of this economy we must reach beyond our own borders to shape the revolution that is tearing down barriers and building new networks among nations and individuals and economies and cultures: globalization its the central reality of our time',\n 'of course change this profound is both liberating and threatening to people but theres no turning back and our open creative society stands to benefit more than any other if we understand and act on the realities of interdependence we have to be at the center of every vital global network as a good neighbor and a good partner we have to recognize that we cannot build our future without helping others to build theirs',\n 'the first thing we have got to do is to forge a new consensus on trade now those of us who believe passionately in the power of open trade we have to ensure that it lifts both our living standards and our values never tolerating abusive child labor or a race to the bottom in the environment and worker protection but others must recognize that open markets and rulebased trade are the best engines we know of for raising living standards reducing global poverty and environmental destruction and assuring the free flow of ideas',\n 'i believe as strongly tonight as i did the first day i got here the only direction forward for america on tradethe only direction for america on trade is to keep going forward i ask you to help me forge that consensus we have to make developing economies our partners in prosperity thats why i would like to ask you again to finalize our groundbreaking african and caribbean basin trade initiatives',\n 'but globalization is about more than economics our purpose must be to bring together the world around freedom and democracy and peace and to oppose those who would tear it apart here are the fundamental challenges i believe america must meet to shape the 21st century world',\n 'first we must continue to encourage our former adversaries russia and china to emerge as stable prosperous democratic nations both are being held back today from reaching their full potential: russia by the legacy of communism an economy in turmoil a cruel and selfdefeating war in chechnya; china by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense of freedom',\n 'but think how much has changed in the past decade: 5000 former soviet nuclear weapons taken out of commission; russian soldiers actually serving with ours in the balkans; russian people electing their leaders for the first time in a thousand years; and in china an economy more open to the world than ever before',\n 'of course no one not a single person in this chamber tonight can know for sure what direction these great nations will take but we do know for sure that we can choose what we do and we should do everything in our power to increase the chance that they will choose wisely to be constructive members of our global community',\n 'thats why we should support those russians who are struggling for a democratic prosperous future; continue to reduce both our nuclear arsenals; and help russia to safeguard weapons and materials that remain',\n 'and thats why i believe congress should support the agreement we negotiated to bring china into the wto by passing permanent normal trade relations with china as soon as possible this year',\n 'i think you ought to do it for two reasons: first of all our markets are already open to china; this agreement will open chinas markets to us; and second it will plainly advance the cause of peace in asia and promote the cause of change in china no we dont know where its going all we can do is decide what were going to do but when all is said and done we need to know we did everything we possibly could to maximize the chance that china will choose the right future',\n 'a second challenge weve got is to protect our own security from conflicts that pose the risk of wider war and threaten our common humanity we cant prevent every conflict or stop every outrage but where our interests are at stake and we can make a difference we should be and we must be peacemakers',\n 'we should be proud of our role in bringing the middle east closer to a lasting peace building peace in northern ireland working for peace in east timor and africa promoting reconciliation between greece and turkey and in cyprus working to defuse these crises between india and pakistan in defending human rights and religious freedom and we should be proud of the men and women of our armed forces and those of our allies who stopped the ethnic cleansing in kosovo enabling a million people to return to their homes',\n 'when slobodan milosevic unleashed his terror on kosovo captain john cherrey was one of the brave airmen who turned the tide and when another american plane was shot down over serbia he flew into the teeth of enemy air defenses to bring his fellow pilot home thanks to our armed forces skill and bravery we prevailed in kosovo without losing a single american in combat i want to introduce captain cherrey to you we honor captain cherrey and we promise you captain well finish the job you began stand up so we can see you',\n 'a third challenge we have is to keep this inexorable march of technology from giving terrorists and potentially hostile nations the means to undermine our defenses keep in mind the same technological advances that have shrunk cell phones to fit in the palms of our hands can also make weapons of terror easier to conceal and easier to use',\n 'we must meet this threat by making effective agreements to restrain nuclear and missile programs in north korea curbing the flow of lethal technology to iran preventing iraq from threatening its neighbors increasing our preparedness against chemical and biological attack protecting our vital computer systems from hackers and criminals and developing a system to defend against new missile threats while working to preserve our abm missile treaty with russia we must do all these things',\n 'i predict to you when most of us are long gone but some time in the next 10 to 20 years the major security threat this country will face will come from the enemies of the nation state: the narcotraffickers and the terrorists and the organized criminals who will be organized together working together with increasing access to evermore sophisticated chemical and biological weapons and i want to thank the pentagon and others for doing what theyre doing right now to try to help protect us and plan for that so that our defenses will be strong i ask for your support to ensure they can succeed',\n 'i also want to ask you for a constructive bipartisan dialog this year to work to build a consensus which i hope will eventually lead to the ratification of the comprehensive nucleartestban treaty',\n 'i hope we can also have a constructive effort to meet the challenge that is presented to our planet by the huge gulf between rich and poor we cannot accept a world in which part of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new economy and the rest live on the bare edge of survival i think we have to do our part to change that with expanded trade expanded aid and the expansion of freedom',\n 'this is interesting: from nigeria to indonesia more people got the right to choose their leaders in 1999 than in 1989 when the berlin wall fell weve got to stand by these democracies including and especially tonight colombia which is fighting narcotraffickers for its own peoples lives and our childrens lives i have proposed a strong 2year package to help colombia win this fight i want to thank the leaders in both parties in both houses for listening to me and the president of colombia about it we have got to pass this i want to ask your help a lot is riding on it and its so important for the longterm stability of our country and for what happens in latin america',\n 'i also want you to know im going to send you new legislation to go after what these drug barons value the most their money and i hope youll pass that as well',\n 'in a world where over a billion people live on less than a dollar a day we also have got to do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debts of the poorest countries so they can invest in education health care and economic growth thats what the pope and other religious leaders have urged us to do and last year congress made a downpayment on americas share i ask you to continue that i thank you for what you did and ask you to stay the course',\n 'i also want to say that america must help more nations to break the bonds of disease last year in africa 10 times as many people died from aids as were killed in wars10 times the budget i give you invests $150 million more in the fight against this and other infectious killers and today i propose a tax credit to speed the development of vaccines for diseases like malaria tb and aids i ask the private sector and our partners around the world to join us in embracing this cause we can save millions of lives together and we ought to do it',\n 'i also want to mention our final challenge which as always is the most important i ask you to pass a national security budget that keeps our military the best trained and best equipped in the world with heightened readiness and 21st century weapons which raises salaries for our service men and women which protects our veterans which fully funds the diplomacy that keeps our soldiers out of war which makes good on our commitment to our un dues and arrears i ask you to pass this budget',\n 'i also want to thank especially two people first i want to thank our secretary of defense bill cohen for symbolizing our bipartisan commitment to national security thank you sir even more i want to thank his wife janet who more than any other american citizen has tirelessly traveled this world to show the support we all feel for our troops thank you janet cohen i appreciate that thank you',\n 'these are the challenges we have to meet so that we can lead the world toward peace and freedom in an era of globalization',\n 'i want to tell you that i am very grateful for many things as president but one of the things im grateful for is the opportunity that the vice president and i have had to finally put to rest the bogus idea that you cannot grow the economy and protect the environment at the same time',\n 'as our economy has grown weve rid more than 500 neighborhoods of toxic waste ensured cleaner air and water for millions of people in the past 3 months alone weve helped preserve 40 million acres of roadless lands in the national forests created three new national monuments',\n 'but as our communities grow our commitment to conservation must continue to grow tonight i propose creating a permanent conservation fund to restore wildlife protect coastlines save natural treasures from the california redwoods to the florida everglades',\n 'this lands legacy endowment would represent by far the most enduring investment in land preservation ever proposed in this house i hope we can get together with all the people with different ideas and do this this is a gift we should give to our children and our grandchildren for all time across party lines we can make an agreement to do this',\n 'one i want you to help us to do three things we need more funding for advanced transit systems we need more funding for saving open spaces in places of heavy development and we need more fundingthis ought to have bipartisan appealwe need more funding for helping major cities around the great lakes protect their waterways and enhance their quality of life we need these things and i want you to help us',\n 'the greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global warming the scientists tell us the 1990s were the hottest decade of the entire millennium if we fail to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases deadly heat waves and droughts will become more frequent coastal areas will flood and economies will be disrupted that is going to happen unless we act',\n 'many people in the united states some people in this chamber and lots of folks around the world still believe you cannot cut greenhouse gas emissions without slowing economic growth in the industrial age that may well have been true but in this digital economy it is not true anymore new technologies make it possible to cut harmful emissions and provide even more growth',\n 'for example just last week automakers unveiled cars that get 70 to 80 miles a gallon the fruits of a unique research partnership between government and industry and before you know it efficient production of biofuels will give us the equivalent of hundreds of miles from a gallon of gasoline',\n 'to speed innovation in these kind of technologies i think we should give a major tax incentive to business for the production of clean energy and to families for buying energysaving homes and appliances and the next generation of super efficient cars when they hit the showroom floor i also ask the auto industry to use the available technologies to make all new cars more fuelefficient right away',\n 'and i ask this congress to do something else please help us make more of our clean energy technology available to the developing world that will create cleaner growth abroad and a lot more new jobs here in the united states of america',\n 'in the new century innovations in science and technology will be key not only to the health of the environment but to miraculous improvements in the quality of our lives and advances in the economy later this year researchers will complete the first draft of the entire human genome the very blueprint of life it is important for all our fellow americans to recognize that federal tax dollars have funded much of this research and that this and other wise investments in science are leading to a revolution in our ability to detect treat and prevent disease',\n 'for example researchers have identified genes that cause parkinsons diabetes and certain kinds of cancer; they are designing precision therapies that will block the harmful effect of these genes for good researchers already are using this new technique to target and destroy cells that cause breast cancer soon we may be able to use it to prevent the onset of alzheimers scientists are also working on an artificial retina to help many blind people to see andlisten to this microchips that would actually directly stimulate damaged spinal cords in a way that could allow people now paralyzed to stand up and walk',\n 'these kinds of innovations are also propelling our remarkable prosperity information technology only includes 8 percent of our employment but now it counts for a third of our economic growth along with jobs that pay by the way about 80 percent above the private sector average again we ought to keep in mind governmentfunded research brought supercomputers the internet and communications satellites into being soon researchers will bring us devices that can translate foreign languages as fast as you can talk materials 10 times stronger than steel at a fraction of the weight andthis is unbelievable to memolecular computers the size of a teardrop with the power of todays fastest supercomputers',\n 'to accelerate the march of discovery across all these disciplines in science and technology i ask you to support my recommendation of an unprecedented $3 billion in the 21st century research fund the largest increase in civilian research in a generation we owe it to our future',\n 'now these new breakthroughs have to be used in ways that reflect our values first and foremost we have to safeguard our citizens privacy last year we proposed to protect every citizens medical record this year we will finalize those rules weve also taken the first steps to protect the privacy of bank and credit card records and other financial statements soon i will send legislation to you to finish that job we must also act to prevent any genetic discrimination whatever by employers or insurers i hope you will support that',\n 'these steps will allow us to lead toward the far frontiers of science and technology they will enhance our health the environment the economy in ways we cant even imagine today but we all know that at a time when science technology and the forces of globalization are bringing so many changes into all our lives its more important than ever that we strengthen the bonds that root us in our local communities and in our national community',\n 'no tie binds different people together like citizen service theres a new spirit of service in america a movement weve tried to support with americorps expanded peace corps unprecedented new partnerships with businesses foundations community groups; partnerships for example like the one that enlisted 12000 companies which have now moved 650000 of our fellow citizens from welfare to work; partnerships to battle drug abuse aids teach young people to read save americas treasures strengthen the arts fight teen pregnancy prevent violence among young people promote racial healing the american people are working together',\n 'but we should do more to help americans help each other first we should help faithbased organizations to do more to fight poverty and drug abuse and help people get back on the right track with initiatives like second chance homes that do so much to help unwed teen mothers second we should support americans who tithe and contribute to charities but dont earn enough to claim a tax deduction for it tonight i propose new tax incentives that would allow low and middle income citizens who dont itemize to get that deduction its nothing but fair and it will get more people to give',\n 'we should do more to help new immigrants to fully participate in our community thats why i recommend spending more to teach them civics and english and since everybody in our community counts weve got to make sure everyone is counted in this years census',\n 'you also have to agree that all those differences you just clapped for all too often spark hatred and division even here at home just in the last couple of years weve seen a man dragged to death in texas just because he was black we saw a young man murdered in wyoming just because he was gay last year we saw the shootings of africanamericans asianamericans and jewish children just because of who they were this is not the american way and we must draw the line',\n 'i ask you to draw that line by passing without delay the \"hate crimes prevention act\" and the \"employment nondiscrimination act\" and i ask you to reauthorize the violence against women act',\n 'finally tonight i propose the largest ever investment in our civil rights laws for enforcement because no american should be subjected to discrimination in finding a home getting a job going to school or securing a loan protections in law should be protections in fact',\n 'last february because i thought this was so important i created the white house office of one america to promote racial reconciliation thats what one of my personal heroes hank aaron has done all his life from his days as our alltime home run king to his recent acts of healing he has always brought people together we should follow his example and were honored to have him with us tonight stand up hank aaron',\n 'i just want to say one more thing about this and i want every one of you to think about this the next time you get mad at one of your colleagues on the other side of the aisle this fall at the white house hillary had one of her millennium dinners and we had this very distinguished scientist there who is an expert in this whole work in the human genome and he said that we are all regardless of race genetically 999 percent the same',\n 'my fellow americans every time i prepare for the state of the union i approach it with hope and expectation and excitement for our nation but tonight is very special because we stand on the mountain top of a new millennium behind us we can look back and see the great expanse of american achievement and before us we can see even greater grander frontiers of possibility we should all of us be filled with gratitude and humility for our present progress and prosperity we should be filled with awe and joy at what lies over the horizon and we should be filled with absolute determination to make the most of it',\n 'you know when the framers finished crafting our constitution in philadelphia benjamin franklin stood in independence hall and he reflected on the carving of the sun that was on the back of a chair he saw the sun was low on the horizon so he said thishe said \"ive often wondered whether that sun was rising or setting today\" franklin said \"i have the happiness to know its a rising sun\" today because each succeeding generation of americans has kept the fire of freedom burning brightly lighting those frontiers of possibility we all still bask in the glow and the warmth of mr franklins rising sun',\n 'after 224 years the american revolution continues we remain a new nation and as long as our dreams outweigh our memories america will be forever young that is our destiny and this is our moment',\n 'thank you god bless you and god bless america']"
